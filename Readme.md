This is a draft of an NFT Studio/Workshop that support traditional artist to enter to the NFT world. This will give them free tools to understand how to elaborate, promote and understand all the things they need to be succesfull in the NFT market or the Studio will select them as an studio artist and work together.

Have 2 projects to test, but they will discuss only with team members and investors.


Some tips:

If you really want to enter in the NFT market you must know some basics that i have learned the hard way.

1. Respect the NFT Community, there are plenty of hardworkers in there. Selling NFT is not an easy task if you don't have a community already build.
2. There is alot of good artist in the space respect them and learn from them.
3. Engage thinking as a community (Share and Comment all kind of art big and small accounts i.e. on Twitter).
4. If you don't have a community build, it will take time. Around 6 to 12 month to make yourself known.
5. At first if you are lucky you could start selling but if you don't start creating and continue creating this will result in even more creative stuff.
6. Test the ideas you made, at first if you don't receive any like maybe it doesn't mean that your art or concept are wrong. You really need to find your audience.
7. Create art that identifies you, this will be why ppl buy your NFTs and will make you an OG.
8. Any human bein is able to create, if you commit and take this seriously your time will come. And when it happen, push harder AF because that is the time for what you have been worked.
